				The field of machine learning and artificial intelligence is growing at a rapid pace and is expanding to fields and industries across the world. From investment banking to medical operations, the idea
					of ML and AI is one that should be well known. The Machine Learning for All @ IU club aims to educate and empower the next generation of data scientists and machine learning engineers by creating a community that deeply cares about current research, future possibilities, and its contributions in the field.
					Welcome to the Future! <b>Welcome to ML4All!</b>

										<h2>Hands-On Workshops</h2>
									</header>
									<p> ML4All is not just about machine learning theory. We want you to learn about fundamental and ground-breaking topics within Machine Learning
									without it feeling like another college lecture. Therefore, our hands-on workshops allow our members to learn about these topics, while also
									applying them using Python. From learning how Teslas use their on-board vision to steer to classifying monsters in Dungeons and Dragons, our
									members love our hands-on workshop sessions as they learn, have fun, and walk away with starter code!</p>

										<h2>Roundtable Discussions</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Learning about machine learning is great but our members often ponder "What is going on in the industry?" In order for our members to
									truly understand the various industries and fields that machine learning and artificial intelligence, we bring in industry trailblazers
									who are applying the concepts learned amongst the organization to corporations such as Netflix, Tesla, and Google! Our Roundtable Discussions
									allow our members to learn more about the real-world applications as well as meet and learn from experts.</p>
